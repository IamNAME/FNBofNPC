# REMINDERS
1. Be sure that you upload your files DIRECTLY into your branch (i.e. not in a folder).
  - There should be (at least) 3 things selected when you upload:
  - FNBofNPC folder (contains VS code)
  - FNBofNPC.sln (the solution file that you run to open the code)
  - README.md (this readme file, should contain any important notes about your branch)
  
2. Any push requests to the master branch require review and approval from at least one project member.
  - ANYONE can review a push request, and a request only needs one approval to be put into action.
  - In the event of a GitHub bug or user error, I can revert push requests.
      ! Note that I CANNOT revert file uploads to your personal branches, so be careful with those.
